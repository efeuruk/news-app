# News App

The project is bootstraped with vite's [react-ts](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)

This is a news app for innoscripta's frontend take home challange. It uses three different api sources to fetch data, which are;

- [News Api](https://newsapi.org/)
- [The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
- [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

The challenging part of this project was all of these api sources were working differently, their parameters did not match, the way of working was very different in each.

## How to run

### To run project locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### With Docker:

Coming soon!
